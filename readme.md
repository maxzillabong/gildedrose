# Gilded Rose in Kotlin

## how to use the application.
Run the GildedRoseTest unit test

It will perform an Approval combination test.
The same test was performed on the old gildedrose java application. 
The OriginalApprovalText.txt in the project root is the result of this test.

At first the original unit test is fixed and rewritten to get a 100% coverage.
Mutation testing was manually performed to make sure the sample data confidently covers all situations

GildedRoseTest.updateQuality.approved.txt can be compared to the old file as evidence that there's no regression.
Only Conjured mana cake is added in the approved txt file.

Optionally you can run the Main.kt CLI just for fun.
